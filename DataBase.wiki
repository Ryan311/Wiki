= SQL =
All SQL operations are then one of four general things(*CRUD*) you do to tables:
Create::
    Putting data into tables.
Read::
    Query data out of a table.
Update::
    Change data already in a table.
Delete::
    Remove data from the table.


== [[SQLite]] ==
SQLite is an embedded database. Rather than running independently as a 
<br>stand-alone process, it symbiotically coexists inside the application
<br>it serves-within its process space.

{{{
Whereas large-scale dedicated relational databases are designed for thousands of users, SQLite is
designed for thousands of uses. It is more than a database. Although a tool in its own right, it is a tool for
making tools as well. It is a true utility, engineered to enable you—the developer, user, or
administrator—to quickly and easily shape those disparate piles of data into order, and manipulate
them to your liking with minimal effort.

=== Install on Ubuntu ===
    *>sudo apt-get install sqlite3*

= NoSQL =
Most of the nosql databases have python clients which are actively supported.
