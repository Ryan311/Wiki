*   Configuration Path
{{{
    * 	A list of directories which will be searched for runtime files:
        *   filetype.vim	filetypes by file name |new-filetype|
        *   scripts.vim	    filetypes by file contents |new-filetype-scripts|
        *   autoload/	    automatically loaded scripts |autoload-functions|

    *   after               This is for personal preferences to overrule or add to the distributed defaults or system-wide settings
    *   autoload            :call filename#funcname     When such a function is called, and it is not defined yet, Vim will search the
                            "autoload" directories in 'runtimepath' for a script file called "filename.vim"

*   [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/102384/using-vims-tabs-like-buffers|tabs vs buffers]]
    *   A buffer is the in-memory text of a file
    *   A window is a viewport on a buffer
    *   A tab page is a collection of windows
    {{{
    Opening multiple files is achieved in vim with buffers. In other editors (e.g. notepad++) this is done with tabs, so the name tab
    in vim maybe misleading. Windows are for the purpose of splitting the workspace and displaying multiple files (buffers) together 
    on one screen. In other editors this could be achieved by opening multiple GUI windows and rearranging them on the desktop. Finally
    in this analogy vim's tabs would correspond to multiple desktops, that is different rearrangements of windows.

    As vim help explains a tab can be used, when one wants to temporary edit a file, but does not want to change anything in the current
    layout of windows and buffers. In such a case another tab can be used just for the purpose of editing that particular file.
    }}}

*   Eval functions
    *   :echo bufwinnr(1)               return the number of the first window accociated with buffer 1
    *   :echo bufwinnr("filepath")      return the number of the first window associated with buffer which file name is "filepath"
    *   :echo bufname(3)                file name in buffer 3
    *   :echo bufname("%")              file name in current buffer
    *   :[count]winc[md] {arg}          like CRTL-W j  <==> :wincmd j
    *   :exec N . "wincmd w"            move cursor to N window     :wincmd equal to CTRL-W
    *   :echo winnr()                   current window number
    *   :echo winnr('$')                window count
    *   :echo tabpagenr()               current tab number
    *   :echo tabpagenr('$')            tab count
    *   :echo tabpagewinnr(2, '$')      number of windows in tag page 2
    *   :echo tabpagewinnr(N)            equal to winnr(N)

*   Variable type in VIM
    *   Number      32 or 64 bit signed number
    *   Float       floating point number
    *   String      NUL terminated string of 8-bit unsigned characters
    *   Funcref     a reference of a function Funcref
    *   List        an ordered sequence of items List
    *   Dictionary  an associative, unordered array, Key:Value pair entry
    *   Convert Function:  str2nr(), str2float(), float2nr()...

*   Internal variable
    *   :let    Create
    *   :unlet  explicitly destroyed
    *   name spaces for variables   
        *   b   local to the current buffer 
        *   w   local to the current window
        *   t   local to the current tab page
        *   g   Global
        *   l   local to a function
        *   s   local to a :source'ed Vim script
        *   a   Function argument(only inside a function)
        *   v   Global, predefined by VIM

*   Buildin Functions

*   :exe[cute] {expr1} ..       executes the string that result from the evaluation of {expr1} as an Ex command
    *   :execute "buffer" 2     go to buffer 2

*   Work Modes
*   Name	Description	help page
    *   normal	For navigation and manipulation of text. This is the mode that vim will usually start in, which you can usually get back to with ESC
    *   insert	For inserting new text. 
    *   visual	For navigation and manipulation of text selections
    *   select	Similar to visual but with a more MS-Window like behavior
    *   command-line	For entering editor commands - like the help command in the 3rd column.  *normal mode type ':'*
    *   Ex-mode	Similar to the command-line mode but optimized for batch processing.    *normal mode type 'Q'*
