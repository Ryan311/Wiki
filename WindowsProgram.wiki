*   CWnd与HWND的区别与转换
{{{
一、区别
    HWND是句柄，CWnd是MFC窗体类,CWnd中包含HWND句柄成员对象是m_hWnd.
    HWND是Windows系统中对所有窗口的一种标识，即窗口句柄。这是一个SDK概念。  
    CWnd是MFC类库中所有窗口类的基类。微软在MFC中将所有窗口的通用操作都封装到了这个类中，
    如：ShowWindow等等，同时它也封装了窗口句柄即m_hWnd成员。

二、如何得到窗口对象指针CWnd * pCWnd
    1,在窗体里，直接用 this->，//this就是本窗体的窗口对象指针
    2,主窗体的类对象指针：AfxGetApp()->m_pMainWnd->,  //AfxGetApp()->m_pMainWnd就是主窗体的窗口对象指针
    3,pCWnd=GetDlgItem(ID_EDIT_NAME);//GetDlgItem 函数可以得到某个控件的窗口对象指针
}}}
*   句柄和ID
{{{
句柄是窗口资源的标识，它标识资源在系统中所占用的内存块，应用程序通过窗口句柄对窗口进行操作。
窗口ID是窗口在应用程序中的唯一标识，通过窗口ID可以获取窗口句柄。
}}}
*   Public Symbols and Private Symbols   
{{{
Typically, symbol files can include any or all of the following symbols:
*   The names and addresses of all functions
*   All data type, structure, and class definitions
*   The names, data types, and addresses of global variables
*   The names, data types, addresses, and scopes of local variables
*   The line numbers in the source code that correspond to each binary instruction

Some program developers might feel uncomfortable sharing all this information with their customers. 
BinPlace can be used to reduce the amount of symbols in a symbol file.

Public Symbols:
    Some basic symbols, such as function names and global variables, are needed for even the most rudimentary debugging. 
    These are called public symbols. 

Private Symbols:
    Symbols such as data structure names, global variables visible in only one object file, local variables, 
    and line number information are not always required for debugging, 
    although they are useful for a more in-depth debugging session. These are called private symbols.

A symbol file that contains both private and public symbols is called a full symbol file. 
A symbol file that contains public symbols alone is called a stripped symbol file. 

Current Symbol File System:
    In the current system, there are always two files: the executable file and a .pdb file. 
    The .pdb file contains all the symbols.
    The executable file contains a pointer to the .pdb file.
