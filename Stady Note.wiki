-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//2013-06-25
1.  GATT 
    The GATT profile is designed to be used by an application or another profile, so that a client 
    can communicate with a server. The server contains a number of attributes, and the GATT Profile 
    defines how to use the Attribute Protocol to discover, read, write and obtain indications of these 
    attributes, as well as configuring broadcast of attributes.

    GATT Client --  This is the device that initiates commands and requests towards the server and can
                    receive responses, indications and notifications sent by the server.

    GATT Server --  This is the device that accepts incoming commands and requests from the client and 
                    sends responses, indications and notifications to a client

    Scenarios covered:
    1) Exchanging configuration
    2) Discovery of services and characteristics on a device
    3) Reading a characteristic value
    4) Writing a characteristic value
    5) Notification of a characteristic value
    6) Indication of a characteristic value


    Profile fundamentals:
    1)  The profile roles are not tied to the controller master/slave roles.
    2)  On an LE Physical link, use of security features such as authorization, authentication and encryption are optional.
    3)  On a BR/EDR physical link encryption is mandatory.


2.  Attribute protocol
    An Attribute is composed of four parts:
    1) Attribute Handle     --- an index corresponding to a specific Attribute
    2) Attribute Type       --- a UUID that descributes the Attribute Value
    3) Attribute Value      --- data described by the Attribute Type and indexed by the Attribute Handle
    4) Attribute Permission --- is part of Attribute that cannot be read from or written to using the ATT Protocol.
                                It is used by the server to determine whether read or write access is permitted for 
                                a given attribute. Attribute Permissions are established by the GATT profile, a higher
                                layer profile or are implementation specific if not specified.
    
    Attribute Caching   !!!
    ---GATT 2.5.2

3.  GATT Hierachy       --- all of the elements are contained by Attributes
    Profile                             is composed of one or more services necessary to fulfill a use case
        --  Service                     is composed of characteristics or references to other services
            --  Characteristic          each contains a value and may contain optional information about the value

    1)  Service      is defined by its service definition which may contain referenced services , mandatory characteristics 
                    and optional characteristics
        There are two types of services:
        1> Primary service
        2> Secondary service

    
4.  1)  Service definition
    A service definition shall contain a service declaration and may contain include definitions and characteristic definitions.
    The service definition ends before the next service declaration or after the maximum Attribute Handle is reached. Service 
    definitions appear on the server in an order based on Attribute Handle.
    
    A service declaration is an Attribute with the Attribute Type set to the UUID for <<Primary Service>>--0x2800 or 
    <<Secondary Service>>--0x2801. The Attribute Value shall be the 16-bit Bluetooth UUID or 128-bit UUID for the service,
    known as the service UUID. 

    2)  Include definition
    An include definition shall contain only one include declaration. 
    The include declaration is an Attribute with the Attribute Type set to the UUID for <<Include>>--0x2802

    3)  Characteristic definition
    A characteristic definition shall contain a characteristic declaration, a Characteristic Value declaration and may contain 
    characteristic descriptor declarations(option).

        Characteristic Declaration:
            A characteristic declaration is an Attribute with the Attribute Type set to the UUID for <<Characteristic>>--0x2803
            and Attribute Value set to the Characteristic Properties, Characteristic Value Attribute Handle and Characteristic UUID. 
            The Attribute Permissions shall be readable and not require authentication or authorization.
        Characteristic Value declaration:
            The Characteristic Value declaration contains the value of the characteristic. It is the first Attribute after the 
            characteristic declaration. All characteristic definitions shall have a Characteristic Value declaration.
        Characteristic Descriptor Declarations:
            Characteristic descriptors are used to contain related information about the Characteristic Value.


    GATT Profile Attribute Types:
    Attribute Type                                  UUID                Description

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//2013-06-21
1.  Non-connected states
1) Standby state
    The Standby State is the default state in the Link Layer. The Link Layer shall 
not send or receive packets in the Standby State. The Link Layer may leave the 
Standby State to enter the Advertising State, Scanning State or Initiator State.

2) Advertising State
    The Link Layer shall enter the Advertising State when directed by the Host. 
When placed in the Advertising State, the Link Layer shall send advertising 
PDUs (see Section 2.3.1) in advertising events on advertising channel.
    An advertising event can be one of the following types:
     advertising event type                     PDU                     response PDU
     a connectable undirected event             ADV_IND                 SCAN_REQ & CONNECTED_REQ
     a connectable directed event               ADV_DIRECT_IND          CONNECTED_REQ        only used in fast connection setup
     a non-connectable undirected event         ADV_NONCONN_IND         NON
     a scannable undirected event               ADV_SCAN_IND            SCAN_REQ
For each advertising event type, a corresponding Advertising Channel PDU is used.
Advertising Channel:
    Advertising events use three predefined advertising channels.    
Advertising Interval:
    For all undirected advertising events, the time between the start of two consecutive advertising events
    T_advEvent = advInterval + advDelay


2) Scanning State
    The Link Layer shall enter the Scanning State when directed by the Host. 
When scanning, the Link Layer shall listen on the advertising channel indices. 
There are two types of scanning, determined by the Host: passive and active.
When in active type, can send SCAN_REQ to request more information from advertiser
When in passive type, only receive packets and cannot send any packets

3) Initiator State
    The Link Layer shall enter the Initiating State when directed by the Host. When 
initiating, the Link Layer shall listen on the advertising channel indices.
    Same to the Scanning state, but use initiator filter policy and send CONNECT_REQ PDU
    

2.  Connected State 
    The Link Layer enters the Connection State when an initiator sends a CONNECT_REQ PDU to an advertiser or 
    an advertiser receives a CONNECT_REQ PDU from an initiator. 

    After entering the Connection State, the connection is considered to be created. The connection is not considered 
to be established at this point. A connection is only considered to be established once a data channel packet has 
been received from the peer device. The only difference between a connection that is created and a connection that is 
established is the Link Layer connection supervision timeout value that is used.

    When two devices are in a connection, the two devices act in different roles. A Link Layer in the Master Role is 
called a master. A Link Layer in the Slave Role is called a slave. The master controls the timing of a connection event. 
A connection event is a point of synchronization between the master and the slave. 

1) Connection events
    The Link Layer in the Connection State shall only transmit Data Channel PDUs 
(see Section 2.4) in connection events. The master and slave shall determine 
the data channel index for each connection event as defined in Section 4.5.8. 
The same data channel index shall be used for all packets in the connection 
event. Each connection event contains at least one packet sent by the master. 
    In a single connection event, the data channel index is not changed

The start of a connection event is called an anchor point. At the anchor point, a 
master shall start to transmit a Data Channel PDU to the slave. The start of 
connection events are spaced regularly with an interval of connInterval and 
shall not overlap. The master shall ensure that a connection event closes at 
least T_IFS before the anchor point of the next connection event. The slave lis-
tens for the packet sent by its master at the anchor point. 
    在每个connection event的开始，总是master先Send data，slave listen for the packet

connInterval:
    The connInterval shall be a multiple of 1.25 ms in the range of 7.5 ms to 4.0 s. 
The connInterval is set by the Initiator’s Link Layer in the CONNNECT_REQ 
PDU from the range given by the Host.

Slave latency:
    Slave latency allows a slave to use a reduced number of connection events. 
The connSlaveLatency parameter defines the number of consecutive connec-
tion events that the slave device is not required to listen for the master.
    When connSlaveLatency is set to zero the slave device shall listen at 
every anchor point. If the slave does not receive a packet from the master after 
applying slave latency, it should listen at each anchor point and not apply slave 
latency until it receives a packet from the master.

connEventCounter:
    Both the master and the slave shall have a 16-bit connection event counter 
(connEventCounter) for each Link Layer connection. It shall be set to zero on 
the first connection event sent by the master of the connection. It shall be incre-
mented by one for each new connection event sent by the master; the 
connEventCounter shall wrap from 0xFFFF to 0x0000. This counter is used to 
synchronize Link Layer control procedures.

2) Supervision Timeout
    To be able to detect link loss, both the master and the slave shall use a Link 
Layer connection supervision timer, TLLconnSupervision. Upon reception of a valid 
packet, the timer shall be reset. 
    每收到一个有效的包，该Timer都会被Reset

    If at any time in Connection State after the connection has been established 
and the timer reaches the connSupervisionTimeout value, the connection shall 
be considered lost.

3) Connection Event Transmit Window     ???
    The CONNECT_REQ PDU includes parameters to determine when the master can 
send its first packet in the Connection State to set the anchor point and when 
the slave must listen.
    两个参数：
    transmitWindowOffset：  告诉slave，master的transmit window开始的时间，在这段时间master会发数据，slave要一直处于listen
    transmitWindowSize:     告诉slave, master的transmit windowr的大小
    当slave收到第一个master pdu时，anchor point就确定了，以后的event的anchor point都由此处开始计算!!!
    master发送第一个packet时，第一个connection event也就开始，以后的connection event也由此处开始计算!!!

4) Closing Connection Events
    MD bit, both 0, slave close the event
    either or both set 1, ......

5)  Acknowledgement and Flow Control
    The Link Layer acknowledgement and flow control scheme shall be used in all 
Link Layer connections.
    For each connection the Link Layer has two parameters, transmitSeqNum and 
nextExpectedSeqNum, each one bit in size. transmitSeqNum is used to iden-
tify packets sent by the Link Layer. nextExpectedSeqNum is used by the peer 
to either acknowledge the last Data Channel PDU sent, or to request resending 
of the last Data Channel PDU sent. 
    transmitSeqNum and nextExpectedSeqNum shall be set to zero upon entering 
the Connection State.
    SN, NESN and MD bits shall be used from every received Data Channel PDU 
which has passed the CRC check.




3.  LINK LAYER DEVICE FILTERING
    A Link Layer shall support Link Layer Device Filtering unless it only supports 
non-connectable advertising.
The filter policies for the Advertising State, Scanning State and Initiating State 
are independent of each other. When the Link Layer is in the Advertising State, 
the advertising filter policy shall be used. When the Link Layer is in the Scan-
ning State, the scanning filter policy shall be used. When the Link Layer is in 
the Initiating State, the initiator filter policy shall be used. If the Link Layer does 
not support the Advertising State, Scanning State, or Initiating State, the corre-
sponding filter policy is not required to be supported.

LinkLay State                       filter policy
Advertising                         advertising filter policy
Scanning                            scanning filter policy
Initiating                          initiator filter policy

White List
    A White List contains a set of White List Records used for Link Layer Device 
Filtering. A White List Record contains both the device address and the device 
address type (public or random). All Link Layers supporting Link Layer Device 
Filtering shall support a White List capable of storing at least one White List 
Record.
    On reset, the White List shall be empty.
    The White List is configured by the Host and is used by the Link Layer to filter 
advertisers, scanners or initiators
    All the device filter policies shall use the same White List        ???

1) Advertising filter policy
    The advertising filter policy determines how the advertiser’s Link Layer processes scan and/or connection requests
    There are four advertising filter policy modes which are configured by the Host     !!!
    Only one advertising filter policy mode shall be supported at a time.
2) Scanner Filter Policy
    The scanner filter policy determines how the scanner’s Link Layer processes advertising packets.
    The Link Layer shall use one of the two following scanner filter policy modes which are configured by the Host  !!!
3) Initiator filter policy
    The initiator filter policy determines how an initiator’s Link Layer processes advertising packets.
    The Link Layer shall use one of the two following initiator filter policy modes which are configured by the Host  !!!

4. LE physical channel
    The LE system operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM band at 2400-2483.5 MHz. The 
LE system uses 40 RF channels. These RF channels have center frequencies 
2402 + k * 2 MHz, where k = 0, ..., 39
    These RF Channels are allocated into two LE physical channels: 
    three advertising channels: for discovering devices, initiating a connection and broadcasting data.
    37 data channels:   for communication between connected devices

    channel index:  is not equal to RF channel map          ie.  RF channel 0 --> LE channel index 37

        derived rom the LAP of the master's BD_ADDR
    > inquiry access code (IAC)
        used in INQUIRY substate
        One GIAC for general inquiry operation
        63 DIACs for dedicated inquiry operation

    the access code also indicates to the receiver the arrival of a packet
    it is used for timing synchronization and offset compensation

7)  Physical Channel    the lowest architectural layer in the Bluetooth system
    defined by  a pseudo-random RF channel hopping sequence       
                the slot timing
                an access code
    All physical channels are subdivided into time slots whose length is different depending on the physical channel,
    Within the physical channel, each reception or transmission event is associated with a time slot or time slots.

    The maximum hop rate is 1600 hops/s in the CONNECTION state
    The maximum hop rate is 3200 hops/s in the inquiry and page substat

    Four bluetooth physical channels are defined:
    the basic piconet channel and adapted piconet channel
        used for communication between connected devices and are associated with a specific piconet
    the inquiry scan channel
        used for discovering
    the page scan channel 
        used for connecting

    A Bluetooth device can only use one of these physical channels at any given time
    In order to support multiple concurrent operations the device uses time-division multiplexing between the channels
    在特定的时间一个BT设备只能使用一种channel，但为了同时支持多个操作，使用时分复用的方式来操作不同的channel。

8)  Basic Piconet channel
    hopping characteristics
        be characterized by a pseudo-random hopping through all 79 RF channels

    time slots
        be divided into time slots, each 625us in length
        the time slots are numbered according to the most significant 27 bits of the bluetooth clock, range from 0 - 2^27-1 and then cycle back
        Master and Slave 时分复用Physical channel, 交替使用slot，例如： f(k), f(k+2), f(k+4) ... f(k+2n) for Master
                                                                        f(k+1), f(k+3), f(k+5) ... f(k+2n+1) for Slave 
        一次传输并不一定只用一个slot，最多可以用5个连续的slots，但必定是交叉使用的。

    Transmit/receive timing
        The master transmission shall always start at even numbered time slots and the slave transmission shall always start at odd numbered time slots
        
9)  Adapted piconet channel
    只使用79个跳频序列的子集

10) Page Scan Physical channel

1.  hop rate in CONNECTED state is 1600 hops/s
    hop rate in Page/Inquire state is 3200 hops/s

    1600 hops/s  <-->   625us
    在连接状态，每个Tx/Rx时隙（slot）对应的一个跳频频带
    Master在做Tx时，一笔数据在一个时隙内要发出去，且用一个频段
    当一笔数据过大，则要占用多个时隙，要在不同的频带上发数据了

    3200 hops/s  <-->   312.5us
    在做Scan或Inquire时，一个Tx/Rx时隙仍然是625us
    但是一个时隙内做了一次跳频。
    由于Scan，inquire的包比较小，一个Tx时隙可以发两笔包，
    所以仍然是一个频带上一笔包。

2.  Page Scan Physical Channel
    在该Channel上，Tx/Rx的时隙也是625us，但是跳频更快一些，3200 hops/s
    即在一个时隙上会发生一次跳频，一个时隙被分成两个不同的频段
    在一个时隙，会发送两笔包，一个频段一笔包
    在Tx时隙，在f(k),f(k+1)两个频段发送paging message

1. BT　efuse设定
需要安装wifi protocal driver
打开rtldbg.exe
RTL_DBG>show bt coexinfo -m
显示bt not exist    表示BT efuse没有设对

修正方法：
1) RTL_DBG>efuse read map
    显示efuse map, 看到0xc0显示为00， 需要修改成20
2）RTL_DBG>efuse write map c1 20
3) RTL_DBG>efuse update
4) RTL_DBG>efuse read map
可以看到0xC0处显示20，这样就可以了
重新拔插卡片再运行show bt coexinfo -m就可以看到BT信息了

2. BT efuse设定，使卡片吐FW log
RTL_DBG>efuse write map 09 20
RTL_DBG>efuse update
在0x09处的字节设置为0x20即可
重新拔插卡片就可以看到FW log了
