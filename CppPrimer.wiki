== Input/Output ==
The C++ language does not define any statements to do input or output (IO).
Instead, C++ includes an extensive standard library(iostream) that provides IO.
    #include <iostream>
    std::cout
    std::cin
    std::cerr
    std::clog
All the names defined by the standard library are in the std namespace
The standard library headers typically have no suffix at all.

== class types ==
C++, allow programmers to define types that include operations as well as data. A
major design goal of C++ is to let programmers define their own types that are as
easy to use as the built-in types.

== Char ==
A char is guaranteed to be big enough to hold numeric values corresponding to the 
characters in the machine’s basic character set. That is, a char is the same size
as a single machine byte.
The remaining character types—wchar_t, char16_t, and char32_t—are used
for extended character sets. The wchar_t type is guaranteed to be large enough to
hold any character in the machine’s largest extended character set. The types
char16_t and char32_t are intended for Unicode characters. (Unicode is a
standard for representing characters used in essentially any natural language.)
