==  BT4.2 Features  ==
#   LE Data Packet Length Extension
#   LE Secure Connections
#   Link Layer Privacy
#   Link Layer Extended Filter Policies

The term for ‘LE privacy v1.2’ is changed to Link Layer Privacy and Link Layer Extended Filter Policies.

==  ble data extension VS ble 2Mbps rate ==
以 throughput 考量, ble data extension 的效益是比 ble 2Mbps rate 还要大, 底下是最大的 ble packet, 考量 maximum asymmetric traffic :

Phy rate 1M : (27 x 8) / (328/1 + 150 + 80/1 + 150) = 0.305 Mbps

Phy rate 2M : (27 x 8) / (328/2 + 150 + 80/2 + 150) = 0.428Mbps

Phy rate 1M + data extension : (251 x 8) / (2120/1 + 150 + 80/1 + 150) = 0.8032Mbps

*   The Windows 8 Bluetooth GATT apis requires that the device be paired using the built-in UI and does not allow application to connect to an arbitrary Bluetooth LE device.
*   Windows上BLE的缺点， 只能通过Buildin UI来scan， pairy设备， 不能将Classic Device和BLE Device区别开来
*   对于BLE设备来说， 有很多情景并不需要配对，如iBeacon，它只支持Advertising，IPhone只需要Scan到它并从Advertising中得到信息就可以了。Windows中对类似iBeacon的应用就不能提供支持
