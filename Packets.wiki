=== ACCESS CODE  ===
*   In the Bluetooth system all transmissions over the physical channel begin with an access code
    * device access code (DAC)      used during page, page scan and page response substates and shall be derived from the paged device’s BD_ADDR
    * channel access code (CAC)     used in the CONNECTION state, synchronization train substate, and synchronization scan substate
    * inquiry access code (IAC)     used in the inquiry substate
*   All access codes are derived from the LAP of a device address or an inquiry address
*   

=== Packet Header ===
{{{ 18 bits
    The header contains link control (LC) information and consists of 6 fields: 
    LT_ADDR:    3-bit logical transport address 
    TYPE:       4-bit type code 
    FLOW:       1-bit flow control 
    ARQN:       1-bit acknowledge indication 
    SEQN:       1-bit sequence number 
    HEC:        8-bit header error check
    
    LSB     3           4       1       1       1       8       MSB

}}}

===  Packet Types  ===
The packets used on the piconet are related to the logical transports on which 
they are used. Four logical transports with distinct packet types are defined 
*   SCO logical transport 
*   eSCO logical transport 
*   ACL logical transport
*   CSB logical transport 

====  Common Packet Types ====
*   ID Packet
*   NULL Packet
    *   no payload, 126 bits
    *   return link information to the source regarding the success of the previous transmission (ARQN), or the status of the RX buffer (FLOW)
    *   The NULL packet may not have to be acknowledged
*   POLL Packet
    *   no payload, 126 bits
    *   requires a confirmation from the recipient
    *   It is not a part of the ARQ scheme
    *   This packet can be used by the master in a piconet to poll the slaves. 
    *   Slaves shall not transmit the POLL packet.
*   FHS Packet  (Frequency Hop Synchronization)
    *   The payload contains 144 information bits plus a 16-bit CRC code. 
    *   The payload is coded with a rate 2/3 FEC(Forward Error Correction code) with a gross payload length of 240 bits
    *   The FHS packet contains real-time clock information
    *   The FHS packet is used in page master response, inquiry response and in role switch.

*   DM1 Packet

=== SCO Packet Types ===
*   HV(High quality Voice) packets do not include a MIC or CRC and shall not be retransmitted
*   DV(Data Voice) packets include a CRC on the data section, but not on the synchronous data section. DV packets do not include a MIC. The data section of DV packets shall be retransmitted
*   HV1 Packet
*   HV2 Packet
*   HV3 Packet
*   DV Packet

=== eSCO Packet Types ===
*   Three eSCO packet types (EV3, EV4, EV5) are defined for Basic Rate operation and four additional eSCO packet types (2-EV3, 3-EV3, 2-EV5, 3-EV5) for Enhanced Data Rate operation.
*   Basic Rate:
    *   EV3 Packet
    *   EV4 Packet
    *   EV5 Packet
*   Enhanced Rate:
    *   2-EV3 Packet    payload is modulated using  π/4-DQPSK
    *   2-EV5 Packet    payload is modulated using  π/4-DQPSK
    *   3-EV3 Packet    payload is modulated using 8DPSK
    *   3-EV5 Packet    payload is modulated using 8DPSK

=== ACL Packets ===
*   M   2/3 FEC enabled
*   Basic Rate:
    *   DM1 Packet
    *   DH1 Packet
    *   DM3 Packet
    *   DH3 Packet
    *   DM5 Packet
    *   DH5 Packet
    *   AUX1 Packet
*   Enhanced Rate:      [symbol rate]-D*[slots]
    *   2-DH1 packet
    *   2-DH3 packet
    *   2-DH5 Packet
    *   3-DH1 packet
    *   3-DH3 Packet
    *   3-DH5 Packet
