==  Bluetooth in 2014   ==
* LE Secure Connections - Host Functionality has been changed
    * Enhances the Security Manager to be compatible with BR/EDR security for 
    * seamless integration for dual-mode 
* LE Secure Connections - HCI Cryptographic... has been changed 
* Huge Attributes has been changed 
* Low Latency Reconnections (LLR) has been changed
* High Accuracy Asset Tracking (HAAT) has been changed
* 2Mbps LE PHY has been changed 
* Public Indoor Positioning has been changed 
* LE Data Packet Length Extension has been added
    * Extends the length of LE data packets 
* LE Advertising Packet Length Extension has been added 
    * Extends the length of LE Advertising packets 
* Slot Availability Mask (SAM) has been changed
    * Allows a Bluetooth device to inform remote devices of available time slots 
    * for transmission and reception. This enhancement is useful for improving 
    * Bluetooth performance in the presence of collocated Mobile Wireless Service (MWS) radios.  
* GATT Improvements has been added 
    * It is proposed that GATT is improved to enable better user experience by 
    * reducing Service Discovery time, using friendly name during pairing, and
    * providing a deterministic characteristic discovery scheme.  
* LE Privacy 1.2 has been changed 
    * Proposes to enhance the LE Privacy feature  of the Core Specification v4.0.  
    * This enhancement will not only increase the level of anonymity for the LE 
    * Peripheral, but also apply the same level of Privacy to the LE Central device. 

==  BT4.2 Features  ==
#   LE Data Packet Length Extension
#   LE Secure Connections
#   Link Layer Privacy
#   Link Layer Extended Filter Policies

==  BLE in Win8+    ==

*   The Windows 8 Bluetooth GATT apis requires that the device be paired using the built-in UI and does not allow application to connect to an arbitrary Bluetooth LE device.
*   Windows上BLE的缺点， 只能通过Buildin UI来scan， pairy设备， 不能将Classic Device和BLE Device区别开来
*   对于BLE设备来说， 有很多情景并不需要配对，如iBeacon，它只支持Advertising，IPhone只需要Scan到它并从Advertising中得到信息就可以了。Windows中对类似iBeacon的应用就不能提供支持
