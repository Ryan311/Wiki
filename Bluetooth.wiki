== Bluetooth Clock ==
*   Every Bluetooth device shall have a native clock that shall be derived from a free running reference clock
*   If the clock is implemented with a counter, a 28-bit counter is required that shall wrap around at 2**28-1
*   Four periods are important in the Bluetooth system: 
    {{{ 
        312.5us <--> 3.2KHz
        ------------------------
        312.5 us    ->      CLK0
        625 us      ->      CLK1    ->  1 slot
        1.25 ms     ->      CLK2
        1.28 s      ->      CLK12  
    }}}
*   A TDD scheme is used where master and slave alternately transmit
    {{images/slot.jpg}}
*   The master transmission shall always start at even numbered time slots (CLK1=0) 
#*   The slave transmission shall always start at odd numbered time slots (CLK1=1)

==  BLUETOOTH Device Addressing ==
*   Each Bluetooth device shall be allocated a unique 48-bit Bluetooth device address (BD_ADDR)
    {{images/BD_Address.jpg}}
*   Reserved Address
    *   A block of 64 contiguous LAPs is reserved for inquiry operations    0x9E8B00-0x9E8B3F
    *   One LAP common to all devices is reserved for general inquiry       0x9E8B33
    *   The remaining 63 LAPs are reserved for dedicated inquiry of specific classes of devices

==  Bluetooth in 2014   ==
* LE Secure Connections - Host Functionality has been changed
    * Enhances the Security Manager to be compatible with BR/EDR security for 
    * seamless integration for dual-mode 
* LE Secure Connections - HCI Cryptographic... has been changed 
* Huge Attributes has been changed 
* Low Latency Reconnections (LLR) has been changed
* High Accuracy Asset Tracking (HAAT) has been changed
* 2Mbps LE PHY has been changed 
* Public Indoor Positioning has been changed 
* LE Data Packet Length Extension has been added
    * Extends the length of LE data packets 
* LE Advertising Packet Length Extension has been added 
    * Extends the length of LE Advertising packets 
* Slot Availability Mask (SAM) has been changed
    * Allows a Bluetooth device to inform remote devices of available time slots 
    * for transmission and reception. This enhancement is useful for improving 
    * Bluetooth performance in the presence of collocated Mobile Wireless Service (MWS) radios.  
* GATT Improvements has been added 
    * It is proposed that GATT is improved to enable better user experience by 
    * reducing Service Discovery time, using friendly name during pairing, and
    * providing a deterministic characteristic discovery scheme.  
* LE Privacy 1.2 has been changed 
    * Proposes to enhance the LE Privacy feature  of the Core Specification v4.0.  
    * This enhancement will not only increase the level of anonymity for the LE 
    * Peripheral, but also apply the same level of Privacy to the LE Central device.
